This is a fork of Unity's Input System. It contains some hacky fixes for weird behaviour with UGUI that will likely not be fixed by Unity.

**Fixes**

- Fixed behaviour where clicking a disabled `Selectable` will deselect your currently selected control
- Fixed controls being deselected when click them with the non-primary mouse button
